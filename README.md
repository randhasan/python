# python
some of my favorite programs i've written using python.  used pygame in almost all of these and got to play around with graphics which i've always enjoyed.
definitely glad python was the first coding language i ever learned back in my freshman year of high school (2018.)
make sure to check out "Hasan_FinalProject".  my favorite CS teacher ever told me to make something that encapsulated all of my knowledge of python and that's been my proudest accomplishment ever since.
